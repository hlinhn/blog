I was curious about the actions in HumanML3D, so I made a simple word cloud out of the descriptions. After removing a few nuisance words (in, at, out, up, to, etc - there were a lot of person and man as well)

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2023-08-29/wc.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Simple HumanML3D word cloud from 29232 files, including the mirrored actions. We removed a lot of positional and directional words to make the actions stand out more. It seems we have a lot of walking action here.
</div>

Then I realized I didn't need to do this - I should be able to get all the verbs from the helpful markers that I discarded the first time round

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2023-08-29/wc-verb.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Word cloud, taking only the words marked with VERB marker.
</div>

At this point we can probably get something a little more concrete by counting the number of verbs and how many times each word appears. We ended up with 1671 unique verbs, the top ten are

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2023-08-29/hist.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

As we have noted before the walking action is quite dominant. Verbs with low count included quite a lot of misspelt words as well as possibly mistagged words such as 'rotatibg', 'leftwhilst', etc.
